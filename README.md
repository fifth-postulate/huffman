# huffman
Huffman encoding in Elm.

## Huffman Code
A [Huffman code][huffman-code] is a

> particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding and/or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman.

## Usage
To install `huffman` to your project execute the following command.

```sh
elm install fifth-postulate/huffman
```

In your project you then can import the `Huffman` module.

```elm
import Huffman
```
